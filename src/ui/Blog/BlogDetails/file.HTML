				In cloud computing, security is of paramount importance. AWS
				(Amazon Web Services) provides a system called IAM (Identity and
				Access Management) to protect your data and resources.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this article, we'll discuss the basics of IAM, including the
				difference between authentication and authorization, a root user,
				IAM users, IAM user groups, IAM roles, and policies.

				The difference between "Authentication" and "Authorization"
			</h2>
			<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mobile:text-xl">
				What is Authentication?
			</h3>

			<p>
				Authentication verifies user identity by validating their claimed
				identity. This involves challenging users to authenticate their
				credentials, like passwords, security question answers, or facial
				recognition. It occurs prior to authorization to safeguard
				protected resources and often utilizes an ID Token for secure
				transmission of user identity information.
			</p>

			<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mobile:text-xl">
				What is Authorization?
			</h3>

			<p>
				Authorization establishes permissions and restrictions for system
				access, verifying access based on predefined policies and rules.
				It occurs after successful authentication, allowing only
				authenticated users with the necessary privileges to access
				specific resources. For secure transmission of authorization
				information, an Access Token is commonly employed.
			</p>

			<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mobile:text-xl">
				To fully understand the difference between "Authentication" and
				"Authorization", consider the following analogy.

				To enter the university building, a registered ID card is
				required, serving as proof of affiliation and authorization. It
				verifies your recognized status within the university community,
				granting permission to access the facilities. This example
				illustrates the process of authentication.

			<p>
				Once you have been granted permission to enter your selected
				university and college, understanding your role and
				responsibilities is essential. For example, as a university
				teacher, you have permission to participate in teaching activities
				and access student records. However, interfering in the
				university's financial affairs does not fall within the scope of
				your permit. This example exemplifies the concept of delegation,
				where specific privileges are granted based on an individual's
				role and responsibilities.
